    "# Working across `panel` and `ipywidgets` ecosystems\n",
    "\n",
    "[`panel`](https://panel.holoviz.org/index.html) is a open source python library that makes it easy to build interactive web apps and dashboards with user defined widgets.  There are a whole set of widgets available to use in the panel library.  However, did you know that you can also use [`ipywidgets`](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) in panel as seamlessly as using panel widgets?  \n",
    "\n",
    "## What are widgets?\n",
    "\n",
    "`panel` and `ipywidgets` have two different patterns for widgets that, in the past, required authors to choose between one ecosystem or the other. The union of these ecosystems opens up enormous possibilities for graphical user interfaces to interact with in notebooks and web applications."

We'll also add a few other `ipywidgets` to change the size and shape of the markers just for fun."

    "Using these `ipywidgets` was as simple as using them just as you would any `panel` widgets!  The great thing about this is that you now have a greater number of widgets available to use within panel applications.  Also, some ipywidgets come with a few different styling options that you may desire instead of what is offered in panel.  Either way, its so nice to have this capability.  "
